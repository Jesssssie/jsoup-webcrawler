Forum A was quite small, and so interactions could be counted by hand.  However, forum B contained tens of thousands of individual posts, and over two hundred users. In order to efficiently and effectively retrieve our specific subset of data from forum B, we created a web crawler using the Java programming language. We used the JSoup API, a Java based HTML parser used for extracting and manipulating data. We implemented our crawler to collect data from the participant’s profiles. This data includes the participant’s forum username, the title of the threads that they created or posted on and the dates of their posts.\r\n\r\n## Useful Links\r\n[User Guide](https://github.com/khiraide/jsoup-webcrawler/wiki/User-Guide)\r\n[Developer Guide](https://github.com/khiraide/jsoup-webcrawler/wiki/Developer-Guide)\r\n[Contact Us](https://github.com/khiraide/jsoup-webcrawler/wiki/Contact-Us)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
