We offer possible explanations to account for the incongruity between online and offline friendships, and examine the reasons people participate in online communities. We focus our study on two small groups of users in two different, online, forum-based communities. One community is a large, well-established, tightly-knit group of gamers, and the other a small, graduate-level class with few prior relationships. We compare the two groups, and discuss the effect of forum and community characteristics on interactions.\r\n\r\nFor our data set forum A and forum B, we needed to measure the frequency of interactions between users who had agreed to participate in our study. Forum A was quite small, and so interactions could be counted by hand.  However, forum B contained tens of thousands of individual posts, and over two hundred users. In order to efficiently and effectively retrieve our specific subset of data from forum B, we created a web crawler using the Java programming language. We used the JSoup API, a Java based HTML parser used for extracting and manipulating data. We implemented our crawler to collect data from the participant’s profiles. This data includes the participant’s forum username, the title of the threads that they created or posted on and the dates of their posts.\r\n\r\n## Useful Links\r\n[User Guide](https://github.com/khiraide/jsoup-webcrawler/wiki/User-Guide)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Developer Guide](https://github.com/khiraide/jsoup-webcrawler/wiki/Developer-Guide)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Contact Us](https://github.com/khiraide/jsoup-webcrawler/wiki/Contact-Us)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
